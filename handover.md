# handover

Basically here's what ive done

- created the tables
- migrated most of the DAO over, but some functions still need moving over.
- noticed that there is a "fake" column in Sections called section_name, this is just used for filtering.
- ive had some trouble getting python db to work, but you will probably be ok (its b/c of my messed up python version)
